# modeling-autism-in-adults
This project, spearheaded by Nicholas McNamara, Uchenna Nwoke, and Sai Sreyas, aims to develop a predictive model for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults. Our objective is to leverage machine learning techniques to create a model that can accurately identify ASD based on various input features. This README outlines the structure of the Jupyter Notebook and guides how to utilize the code and data for research and development purposes.
